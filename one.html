        <p>Hello Everyone! This is Iftikhar and welcome to my Website!I work as a Software Engineer for The Boeing Company. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Stony Brook University.
            Despite my background in Electrical Engineering, I realized in school that I enjoyed working on the software engineering side more and 
            gradually gravitated towards that career path. Within Boeing, I work for the V22 Osprey Tiltorotor Aircraft Program. This is an incredibly
            versatile aircraft which can take off vertically like a helicopter and transform into a high speed cruise turboprop aircraft while flying.
            I feel incredibly proud to work on this aircraft everyday.I joined the Masters of Software Development Program at BUMET to expand on my knowledge as a Software Developer as I hope to pursue a lifelong 
            career in this industry. So far, I have had the opportunity to work in Firmware Development, Embedded Software and Low Level Real Time C/C++
            Software Development. This program is helping me to expand my horizon and explore other areas of the industry such as Web Application 
            Development. In my spare time, I love to play video games and watch soccer.

            <p>Please enjoy an interesting video of the V22 Osprey in Action! The video demonstrates how the aircraft takes off like a helicopter and 
               gradually moves the nacelles forward to transform into a turboprop airplane and fly significantly faster! Very Cool!
